A Javascript browsing and editing interface for an Open511 Events API.

Currently under early, heavy development.

While the application itself is in-browser JavaScript, it's packaged here
as a Python/Django application, since that's what we're using for builds
and asset packaging. Once we're ready to release an initial version,
we'll be publishing a ready-to-go HTML/JS build. In the meantime, if you'd
like to try it out, your best bet is to use
our [open511_site](http://www.github.com/opennorth/open511_site) sample project.
